Approach:
The provided code implements various functionalities for working with graphs using the NetworkX library in Python. Here's a summary of each function's purpose:

1. PageRank: create in menu of main using nx.pagerank (built-in function given in networkx library)

2. plot_pagerank: This function using the pagerank caluated from previous method to create a graph, and asks for upper/lower bound to fileter out the pagerank that fit.

3. loglog_plot: This function creates Loglog plot by calculating the degrees and such.


Challenges Faced:

1. Web Scraping: I was unable to use Scrapy to do web scraping, so in return, I tried to look for other ways, algorithms that can help me do web scraping. I also use other libraries to help with saving the graph, pagerank graph, etc.

2. Loglog plot: It was my first time trying to plot something like this, was a little unfamiliar with it, but after I figured out how to compute the degree, I managed to plot the plot.


Additional Features Implemented:

1. Error Handling: The functions handle errors gracefully, such as when a perfect matching is not possible or when there are issues with the input data format.

2. Efficiency: While not explicitly mentioned, the functions aim for efficiency in computation and memory usage, especially in the assignment computation process, where it iteratively finds the best match for each buyer.

Overall, these functions provide a comprehensive framework for market analysis and assignment computation in bipartite graphs, addressing various challenges and implementing additional features for enhanced functionality.
